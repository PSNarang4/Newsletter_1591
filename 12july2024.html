          <div> <h1>1. Brothers Fight On Field: Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan Clash Leaves Fans In Shock</h1>
        <p>
            In a surprising and unsettling turn of events, brothers Irfan and Yusuf Pathan were involved in a heated altercation during the India vs South Africa Champions match. The incident, which occurred during a crucial moment in the game, has left fans and teammates shocked.
It all happened in the penultimate over of the Indian innings, which was bowled by Dale Steyn. Irfan Pathan went for a big heave but only got a top edge that went towards long-off. While the catch was not taken, the Proteas fielder promptly threw the ball back.
Amidst the chaos, Irfan, who wanted the second, had already reached halfway down the pitch, but his elder brother did not want to come back for the second, leading to the southpaw's runout.

    <h1>2. The Embattled Biden Campaign Tests Kamala Harris’s Strength vs. Trump</h1>
    <p>
        Under siege from fellow Democrats, President Biden’s campaign is quietly testing the strength of Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald J. Trump in a head-to-head survey of voters, as Mr. Biden fights for his political future with a high-stakes news conference on Thursday.
The survey, which is being conducted this week and was commissioned by the Biden campaign’s analytics team, is believed to be the first time since the debate that Mr. Biden’s aides have sought to measure how the vice president would fare at the top of the ticket. It was described by three people who are informed about it and insisted on anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information.
They did not specify why the survey was being conducted or what the campaign planned to do with the results. It could be read as the team gathering information to present a case to the president that his path forward is slim, or to argue that Mr. Biden is still the strongest standard-bearer for his party.
The effort comes as some longtime aides and advisers to Mr. Biden are said to have become increasingly convinced that he will have to step aside from the campaign, and in recent days have been trying to come up with ways to persuade him that he should, The New York Times reported on Thursday. A growing number of prominent lawmakers have called for Mr. Biden to drop out or suggest he should reconsider his plans to run.
While some of Mr. Biden’s top aides have quietly argued that Ms. Harris could not win the election, donors and other outside supporters of the vice president believe she might be in a stronger position after the debate, and could be a more energetic communicator of the party’s message.
In a memo to campaign staff on Thursday, Mr. Biden’s campaign chair, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, and his campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, wrote about the “path ahead.”
“In addition to what we believe is a clear pathway ahead for us, there is also no indication that anyone else would outperform the president vs. Trump,” they wrote. “Hypothetical polling of alternative nominees will always be unreliable, and surveys do not take into account the negative media environment that any Democratic nominee will encounter. The only Democratic candidate for whom this is already baked in is President Biden.”

            With broiling hot weather baking much of the country, airline passengers are finding yet another reason to dread flying: airplane cabins that feel like saunas
            When planes are waiting at the gate or sitting on an airport runway, temperatures inside can soar, and the air-conditioning may barely function.
            In 2018, the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing those workers, petitioned the U.S. Department of Transportation to set minimum standards for cabin temperatures.
            But the department said this week that it was still studying the issue, and the complaints from passengers and crew members have not stopped. Some of them warn of the dangers of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses, not to mention the anxiety and the discomfort of feeling trapped in an overheated airplane cabin.
            “I can tell you as an active flight attendant, this is a major problem,” said Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants. “Everyone has a story about being too hot on an aircraft and the horrible things that happen as a result.”

            <h1>4. Wanted: A Miracle Worker on Migration</h1>
            <p>
                Wanted: an “exceptional leader” with experience in policing, intelligence or the military, who is ready to tackle one of the thorniest issues in British politics.
Days after coming to power, Britain’s government is recruiting a chief for a new Border Security Command to “smash,” the job description says, the smuggling gangs that help asylum seekers arrive from France on small, often unseaworthy, boats.
The search for the border security commander is the first action taken by the new Labour government to address the unauthorized landings that have become an embarrassing symbol of Britain’s failure to control its borders.
Its human cost was underscored on Friday when the French authorities said four people had died after attempting the crossing near Boulogne-sur-Mer, with a further 63 rescued.
Immigration is a divisive political topic across Europe, and in Britain the issue of migrants arriving on small boats fueled gains in the general election last week by the anti-immigration party Reform U.K., led by Nigel Farage.
Britain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, has also scrapped an expensive plan championed by the government of his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, to send to Rwanda some of the tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have arrived on the southern English coast. Mr. Starmer described the plan — which was stalled by legal challenges that prevented anyone being put on a flight — as “dead and buried.

                <h1>5. By 2100, India's Population To Decline, But Still Be 2.5 Times That Of China</h1>
                <p>
                    The World Population Prospects 2024 report, released here on Thursday, said that the world's population is expected to continue growing over the coming 50-60 years, reaching a peak of around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, the global population is projected to start declining gradually, falling to 10.2 billion people by the end of the century.
India, which surpassed China as the world's most populous nation last year, will continue to hold that position through 2100.
"The population of India, which is expected to remain the world's largest throughout the century, will likely decline by 12 per cent after reaching its peak in the early 2060s at about 1.7 billion," the UN report published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Population Division said.
According to the report, India's population in 2024 is projected at 1.45 billion and this will peak to 1.69 billion in 2054. After this, India's population is projected to decline to 1.5 billion by the end of the century in 2100, but the country will still remain the most populous nation on Earth.

                        <h1>7. A Hurricane Divide in Houston: Who Has a Generator?
    </h1>
                        <p>
                            When the power goes out in Houston, some neighborhoods are filled with the sound of gas-powered backup generators, creating an instant sonic guide to the city’s social divisions.
                            In wealthier parts of the city, the sheer number of generators can create a pervasive roar. In other neighborhoods, there is a low rumble from a handful of machines — or just one.
                            “My neighbor has it just for his fridge,” said Theresa Del Bosque, 62, describing the rare home in her north Houston area with a generator. “Most people cannot afford it.”
                            With around a million customers still without power on Thursday, more than three days after Hurricane Beryl tore through the city, the question of who has a generator, and who can get one, has become an urgent one.         
                            Even for residents who could afford the often steep prices, finding a generator was proving to be a challenge in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The ones left on Thursday were still flying off the shelves at hardware stores where even the cheaper versions were priced at nearly $1,000.  
                            A Harris County sheriff’s deputy stood guard at a Home Depot in north Houston that had recently received a shipment of generators and chain saws, for cutting apart fallen trees. The store had already reached an occupancy limit, and a line stretched outside of those waiting to get in.       
                            With so many people suffering in the heat, and a limited number of generators available, many who have their generators roaring outside have grown concerned about theft.

        </h1>
                            <p>
                                Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally, greeted his party’s 125 newly elected lawmakers on Wednesday morning with a few congratulations — and a lot of warnings.
                                “You are a source of pride for millions of French people,” Mr. Bardella told the lawmakers after they entered the National Assembly, France’s lower house of Parliament, to take their seats. But now, he added, “your responsibility, my dear friends, will be to underline the credibility of our project” and “to be absolutely irreproachable in the field and with the media.”
                                It was a none-too-subtle reference to the controversies that marred the National Rally’s campaign in France’s snap parliamentary elections. Many party candidates made racist remarks, failed to articulate their positions or were featured in French newspaper coverage for past antisemitic comments and pro-Kremlin positions. One candidate was pulled from the race after a photograph of her wearing a Nazi cap appeared on social media.
                                Several National Rally leaders and analysts said the controversies played a role in the party’s third place finish after it had been widely expected to win. The disappointing election results have now placed the National Rally at a crossroads as it looks toward presidential elections in 2027.

            </h1>
                                <p>
                                    Former President Donald J. Trump hawks $59.99 Bibles with the same words he uses to win the votes of evangelical Christians. He sells swatches of the suit he wore in a mug shot while also raising money for his campaign by calling himself a “political prisoner.” He describes Truth Social, his refuge for those banned on other social media sites — and his best chance to substantially increase his wealth — as a bulwark against liberal companies out to silence Christians and conservatives.
                                    As he seeks to reclaim the presidency, Mr. Trump has reprised the pitchman role from his reality TV days, with a crucial difference: He has intertwined the marketing of his private business affairs with the messaging of his campaign, leveraging his political stature for profit.             
                                    All of it could be described as Martyr Inc., a machinery that makes Mr. Trump money and promotes his re-election by characterizing him as unjustly persecuted and selflessly saving his supporters from a similar fate.  
                                    His most loyal followers have gone along for the ride, forming a niche marketplace for products bearing the Trump name and vowing to help prop up the stock price for the company that owns Truth Social. Even after recent declines, Mr. Trump’s shares are worth more than $3 billion, though he cannot yet sell. With Mr. Trump’s tacit encouragement, his supporters have characterized buying Trump products as a measure of patriotism. That was the former president’s message in his Truth Social pitch for the customized Bible on the cusp of the Independence Day holiday: “Every Patriot should have one.”

Millions have been spent on diamonds and emeralds the size of credit cards, on haute couture saris, on wedding invitations made of silver and gold.

Rihanna performed. In May, the bride and groom-to-be threw a four-day party on a luxury cruise ship in the Mediterranean; Ms. Merchant told Vogue India they couldn’t find a land venue big enough to host all their guests.
